Instructions for making this project:

Row 1: 1 slip stitch, 42 single crochets

Row 2: 1 single crochet, (skip a stitch, double crochet in the next stitch, chain one), and repeat the part in the brackets until the end of the row

Row 3: (double crochet, chain one, and skip a stitch, all in the "hole" created by skipping a stitch in the previous row) until the end of the row, then double crochet and chain one, in the first chain stitch of the previous row (between the previous row and the one before it)

Row 4: (double crochet and chain one in the "hole" formed by skipping a stitch in the previous row) and repeat the part in the brackets until the end of the row

Repeat Row 4 until the piece is long enough for you to wear.

Note: If the sides of the piece start expanding, skip the first "hole" (created by skipping a stitch in the previous row) in the row and move on to the next one.
